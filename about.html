        <p>We came up with the idea for The Local Hiker after many years of traveling to neighboring counties to purchase quality gear and clothing for hiking, backpacking and camping trips. We kept wondering why there wasn't a store in Spartanburg! During the summer of 2011 we drove around downtown looking at different locations and really started fostering the idea of opening such a store ourselves. We didn't have a name or anything else at that point, just the idea.</p>
        <p>January 2012 we met with what is now our current lease holder, looked at his building and shared a little bit of our vision with him. We really started planning at this point, worked on a business plan, financing, creating relationships with vendors, etc. funding was a tough hurdle to overcome with the economy in the state it was in at the time. Then in December 2012 we saw an article in the paper for the Main Street Challenge. We thought it would be foolish to pass up an opportunity like that, so we entered.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-text col-md-6">
        <p>Over the next five months we went through the rigorous application process with the city of Spartanburg, went before a selection committee to present our concept in hopes of being one of the three finalists for the grand prize.</p>
        <p>May 2013 was the reveal of the three winners at an event called The Main Event. We were the second business announced as one of the winners and could not of been happier! We signed the lease at the original location we'd hoped for back on that cold January day in 2012 and the next round of work and challenges began.</p>
        <p>October 25, 2013 was our first day of business! There has been so much support from the city, other business owners and the citizens of Spartanburg county. We have been blessed beyond measure. We are looking forward to being your store of choice for all your hiking, backpacking and camping needs right here in Spartanburg.</p>

            <p class="team-info">I grew up in a small town in central NC. My family did more car camping than anything else. It wasn't until I was an adult that I started to venture into hiking and backpacking. I volunteered to be a Girl Scout leader when our daughter started as a Daisy scout at age 5. That led to lots of trips out and about in different places. During that time I also volunteered with our local Boy Scout troop. If asked what my favorite part of hiking is I think I'd have to say the peacefulness of my surroundings while I'm out on the trail. That is definitely followed very closely by the spectacular views I happen upon. Some I know about ahead of time, but the ones I'm not expecting make my day complete! I typically do more day hiking than long distance backpacking, but I enjoy both! Camping is also a favorite, however not so much cold weather camping. I'm a big cold weather wimp!
